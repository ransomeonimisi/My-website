        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul id="ul">
            <li>2-3 large eggs</li>
            <li>Salt, to taste</li>
            <li>Pepper, to taste</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon of butter or oil</li>
            <li>Optional fillings: cheese, diced vegetables, cooked meats, herbs</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Beat the eggs:</b> In a bowl, beat the eggs with a pinch of salt and pepper until they are well mixed. 
                You can add a tablespoon of water or milk for a fluffier texture.</li>
            <li><b>Heat the pan:</b> Place a non-stick frying pan over medium heat and add butter or oil.</li>
            <li><b>Cook the omelette:</b> Once the butter is melted and bubbling, pour in the eggs. Tilt the pan to ensure 
                the eggs evenly coat the surface.</li>
            <li><b>Add fillings</b> (optional): When the eggs begin to set at the edges but are still slightly runny in the 
                middle, sprinkle your chosen fillings over one half of the omelette.</li>
            <li>
                <b>Fold and serve:</b> As the omelette continues to cook, carefully lift one edge and fold it over the 
                fillings. Let it cook for another minute, then slide it onto a plate.
              </li>
            <li>
                <b>Enjoy:</b> Serve hot, with additional salt and pepper if needed.
            </li>
